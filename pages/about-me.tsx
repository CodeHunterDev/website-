							Hey there, I'm Piyush, a Front-end developer from India. I love building beautiful websites
							using React. I've worked with JavaScript the most and like to keep up with its advancements.
						</p>
						<p className="about-me__info">
							UI/UX design is something that I've been getting into besides Front-end development. It has
							been helping me by building a bridge to get a view of a designer and a developer. I've tried
							my hands on UI designing, which can be found on Dribbble.
